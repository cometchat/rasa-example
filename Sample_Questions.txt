## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Always start with** "show me restaurants" or "I'm hungry"
2. **Then filter** with specific criteria
3. **Use actual cuisine names** from the database (Mexican, Italian, Chinese, American, Indian, Japanese, Healthy)
4. **Be specific with numbers** when asking for "top N"
5. **Combine filters naturally** like "top 3 Mexican restaurants with WiFi"

### What Works Well:
✅ Natural language queries
✅ Cuisine names (case insensitive)
✅ Rating-based sorting
✅ WiFi filtering
✅ Distance calculations
✅ Multi-turn conversations

### What Might Need Clarification:
⚠️ Very complex multi-criteria queries (break into steps)
⚠️ Ambiguous references without context
⚠️ Restaurants not in the database
⚠️ Requests for features not supported (reservations, reviews, etc.)

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Case insensitive**: "mexican", "Mexican", "MEXICAN" all work
- **Synonyms work**: "top", "best", "highest rated" are equivalent
- **Context maintained**: Bot remembers previous restaurants shown
- **100+ variations**: OpenAI understands many phrasings
- **Emoji support**: Bot responses include emojis for better UX
